   *
   * @param \Drupal\field\FieldInterface $field
   *   The field definition.
   *
   * @return array
   *   An associative array with the following key/value pairs:
   *   - columns: An array of Schema API column specifications, keyed by column
   *     name. This specifies what comprises a value for a given field. For
   *     example, a value for a number field is simply 'value', while a value
   *     for a formatted text field is the combination of 'value' and 'format'.
   *     It is recommended to avoid having the column definitions depend on
   *     field settings when possible. No assumptions should be made on how
   *     storage engines internally use the original column name to structure
   *     their storage.
   *   - indexes: (optional) An array of Schema API index definitions. Only
   *     columns that appear in the 'columns' array are allowed. Those indexes
   *     will be used as default indexes. Callers of field_create_field() can
   *     specify additional indexes or, at their own risk, modify the default
   *     indexes specified by the field-type module. Some storage engines might
   *     not support indexes.
   *   - foreign keys: (optional) An array of Schema API foreign key
   *     definitions. Note, however, that the field data is not necessarily
   *     stored in SQL. Also, the possible usage is limited, as you cannot
   *     specify another field as related, only existing SQL tables,
   *     such as {taxonomy_term_data}.
