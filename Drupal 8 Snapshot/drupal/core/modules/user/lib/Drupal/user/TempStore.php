/**
 * Stores and retrieves temporary data for a given owner.
 *
 * A TempStore can be used to make temporary, non-cache data available across
 * requests. The data for the TempStore is stored in one key/value collection.
 * TempStore data expires automatically after a given timeframe.
 *
 * The TempStore is different from a cache, because the data in it is not yet
 * saved permanently and so it cannot be rebuilt. Typically, the TempStore
 * might be used to store work in progress that is later saved permanently
 * elsewhere, e.g. autosave data, multistep forms, or in-progress changes
 * to complex configuration that are not ready to be saved.
 *
 * Each TempStore belongs to a particular owner (e.g. a user, session, or
 * process). Multiple owners may use the same key/value collection, and the
 * owner is stored along with the key/value pair.
 *
 * Every key is unique within the collection, so the TempStore can check
 * whether a particular key is already set by a different owner. This is
 * useful for informing one owner that the data is already in use by another;
 * for example, to let one user know that another user is in the process of
 * editing certain data, or even to restrict other users from editing it at
 * the same time. It is the responsibility of the implementation to decide
 * when and whether one owner can use or update another owner's data.
 *
 * @todo We could add getIfOwner() or setIfOwner() methods to make this more
 *   explicit.
