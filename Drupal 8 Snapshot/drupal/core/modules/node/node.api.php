 * Functions to define and modify content types.
 *
 * Each content type is maintained by a primary module, which is either
 * node.module (for content types created in the user interface) or the module
 * that defines the content type by providing configuration file.
 *
 * During node operations (create, insert, update, view, delete, etc.), there
 * are several sets of hooks that get invoked to allow modules to modify the
 * base node operation:
 * - All-module hooks: This set of hooks is invoked on all implementing modules,
 *   to allow other modules to modify what the primary node module is doing. For
 *   example, hook_node_insert() is invoked on all modules when creating a forum
 *   node.
 * - Field hooks: Hooks related to the fields attached to the node. These are
 *   invoked from the field operations functions described below, and can be
 *   either field-type-specific or all-module hooks.
 * - Entity hooks: Generic hooks for "entity" operations. These are always
 *   invoked on all modules.
 *
 * Here is a list of the node and entity hooks that are invoked, field
 * operations, and other steps that take place during node operations:
 * - Instantiating a new node:
 *   - hook_node_create() (all)
 *   - hook_entity_create() (all)

 *   - field_attach_load_revision() and field_attach_load()
 *   - hook_entity_load() (all)
 *   - hook_node_load() (all)
 * - Viewing a single node (calling node_view() - note that the input to

/**
 * Inform the node access system what permissions the user has.
 *
 * This hook is for implementation by node access modules. In this hook,
 * the module grants a user different "grant IDs" within one or more
 * "realms". In hook_node_access_records(), the realms and grant IDs are
 * associated with permission to view, edit, and delete individual nodes.
 *
 * The realms and grant IDs can be arbitrarily defined by your node access
 * module; it is common to use role IDs as grant IDs, but that is not required.
 * Your module could instead maintain its own list of users, where each list has
 * an ID. In that case, the return value of this hook would be an array of the
 * list IDs that this user is a member of.
 *
 * A node access module may implement as many realms as necessary to properly
 * define the access privileges for the nodes. Note that the system makes no
 * distinction between published and unpublished nodes. It is the module's
 * responsibility to provide appropriate realms to limit access to unpublished
 * content.
 *
 * Node access records are stored in the {node_access} table and define which
 * grants are required to access a node. There is a special case for the view
 * operation -- a record with node ID 0 corresponds to a "view all" grant for
 * the realm and grant ID of that record. If there are no node access modules
 * enabled, the core node module adds a node ID 0 record for realm 'all'. Node
 * access modules can also grant "view all" permission on their custom realms;
 * for example, a module could create a record in {node_access} with:
 * @code
 * $record = array(
 *   'nid' => 0,
 *   'gid' => 888,
 *   'realm' => 'example_realm',
 *   'grant_view' => 1,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 * );
 * drupal_write_record('node_access', $record);
 * @endcode
 * And then in its hook_node_grants() implementation, it would need to return:
 * @code
 * if ($op == 'view') {
 *   $grants['example_realm'] = array(888);
 * }
 * @endcode
 * If you decide to do this, be aware that the node_access_rebuild() function
 * will erase any node ID 0 entry when it is called, so you will need to make
 * sure to restore your {node_access} record after node_access_rebuild() is
 * called.
 *
 * @param $account
 *   The user object whose grants are requested.
 * @param $op
 *   The node operation to be performed, such as 'view', 'update', or 'delete'.
 *
 * @return
 *   An array whose keys are "realms" of grants, and whose values are arrays of
 *   the grant IDs within this realm that this user is being granted.
 *
 * For a detailed example, see node_access_example.module.
 *
 * @see node_access_view_all_nodes()

/**
 * Set permissions for a node to be written to the database.
 *
 * When a node is saved, a module implementing hook_node_access_records() will
 * be asked if it is interested in the access permissions for a node. If it is
 * interested, it must respond with an array of permissions arrays for that
 * node.
 *
 * Node access grants apply regardless of the published or unpublished status
 * of the node. Implementations must make sure not to grant access to
 * unpublished nodes if they don't want to change the standard access control
 * behavior. Your module may need to create a separate access realm to handle
 * access to unpublished nodes.
 *
 * Note that the grant values in the return value from your hook must be
 * integers and not boolean TRUE and FALSE.
 *
 * Each permissions item in the array is an array with the following elements:
 * - 'realm': The name of a realm that the module has defined in
 *   hook_node_grants().
 * - 'gid': A 'grant ID' from hook_node_grants().
 * - 'grant_view': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can view this node. This should usually be
 *   set to $node->status. Failure to do so may expose unpublished content
 *   to some users.
 * - 'grant_update': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can edit this node.
 * - 'grant_delete': If set to 1 a user that has been identified as a member
 *   of this gid within this realm can delete this node.
 * - langcode: (optional) The language code of a specific translation of the
 *   node, if any. Modules may add this key to grant different access to
 *   different translations of a node, such that (e.g.) a particular group is
 *   granted access to edit the Catalan version of the node, but not the
 *   Hungarian version. If no value is provided, the langcode is set
 *   automatically from the $node parameter and the node's original language (if
 *   specified) is used as a fallback. Only specify multiple grant records with
 *   different languages for a node if the site has those languages configured.
 *
 * A "deny all" grant may be used to deny all access to a particular node or
 * node translation:
 * @code
 * $grants[] = array(
 *   'realm' => 'all',
 *   'gid' => 0,
 *   'grant_view' => 0,
 *   'grant_update' => 0,
 *   'grant_delete' => 0,
 *   'langcode' => 'ca',
 * );
 * @endcode
 * Note that another module node access module could override this by granting
 * access to one or more nodes, since grants are additive. To enforce that
 * access is denied in a particular case, use hook_node_access_records_alter().
 * Also note that a deny all is not written to the database; denies are
 * implicit.

/**
 * Provide additional methods of scoring for core search results for nodes.
 *
 * A node's search score is used to rank it among other nodes matched by the
 * search, with the highest-ranked nodes appearing first in the search listing.
 *
 * For example, a module allowing users to vote on content could expose an
 * option to allow search results' rankings to be influenced by the average
 * voting score of a node.
 *
 * All scoring mechanisms are provided as options to site administrators, and
 * may be tweaked based on individual sites or disabled altogether if they do
 * not make sense. Individual scoring mechanisms, if enabled, are assigned a
 * weight from 1 to 10. The weight represents the factor of magnification of
 * the ranking mechanism, with higher-weighted ranking mechanisms having more
 * influence. In order for the weight system to work, each scoring mechanism
 * must return a value between 0 and 1 for every node. That value is then
 * multiplied by the administrator-assigned weight for the ranking mechanism,
 * and then the weighted scores from all ranking mechanisms are added, which
 * brings about the same result as a weighted average.
 *
 * @return
 *   An associative array of ranking data. The keys should be strings,
 *   corresponding to the internal name of the ranking mechanism, such as
 *   'recent', or 'comments'. The values should be arrays themselves, with the
 *   following keys available:
 *   - title: (required) The human readable name of the ranking mechanism.
 *   - join: (optional) The part of a query string to join to any additional
 *     necessary table. This is not necessary if the table required is already
 *     joined to by the base query, such as for the {node} table. Other tables
 *     should use the full table name as an alias to avoid naming collisions.
 *   - score: (required) The part of a query string to calculate the score for
 *     the ranking mechanism based on values in the database. This does not need
 *     to be wrapped in parentheses, as it will be done automatically; it also
 *     does not need to take the weighted system into account, as it will be
 *     done automatically. It does, however, need to calculate a decimal between
 *     0 and 1; be careful not to cast the entire score to an integer by
 *     inadvertently introducing a variable argument.
 *   - arguments: (optional) If any arguments are required for the score, they
 *     can be specified in an array here.
