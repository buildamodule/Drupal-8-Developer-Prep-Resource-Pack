/**
 * @file
 * Default theme implementation for displaying a single search result.
 *
 * This template renders a single search result and is collected into
 * search-results.html.twig. This and the parent template are
 * dependent to one another sharing the markup for ordered lists.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - url: URL of the result.
 * - title: Title of the result.
 * - snippet: A small preview of the result. Does not apply to user searches.
 * - info: String of all the meta information ready for print. Does not apply
 *   to user searches.
 * - module: The machine-readable name of the module (tab) being searched, such
 *   as "node" or "user".
 * - title_prefix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed in front of the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - title_suffix: Additional output populated by modules, intended to be
 *   displayed after the main title tag that appears in the template.
 * - info_split: Contains same data as info, but split into separate parts.
 *   - info_split.type: Node type (or item type string supplied by module).
 *   - info_split.user: Author of the node linked to users profile. Depends
 *     on permission.
 *   - info_split.date: Last update of the node. Short formatted.
 *   - info_split.comment: Number of comments output as "% comments", %
 *     being the count. (Depends on comment.module).
 * @todo The info variable needs to be made drillable and each of these sub
 *   items should instead be within info and renamed info.foo, info.bar, etc.
 *
 * Other variables:
 * - title_attributes: HTML attributes for the title.
 * - content_attributes: HTML attributes for the content.
 *
 * Since info_split is keyed, a direct print of the item is possible.
 * This array does not apply to user searches so it is recommended to check
 * for its existence before printing. The default keys of 'type', 'user' and
 * 'date' always exist for node searches. Modules may provide other data.
 * @code
 *   {% if (info_split.comment) %}
 *     <span class="info-comment">
 *       {{ info_split.comment }}
 *     </span>
 *   {% endif %}
 * @endcode
 *
 * To check for all available data within info_split, use the code below.
 * @code
 *   <pre>
 *     {{ dump(info_split) }}
 *   </pre>
 * @endcode
 *
 * @see template_preprocess_search_result()
 *
 * @ingroup themeable
