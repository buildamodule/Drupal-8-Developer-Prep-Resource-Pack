 * interface text elsewhere is wrapped in t() to make it translatable, in plugin
 * annotation, wrap translatable strings in the @ Translation() annotation.
 * For example:
 * @code
 *   title = @ Translation("Title of the plugin"),
 * @endcode
 * Remove spaces after @ in your actual plugin - these are put into this sample
 * code so that it is not recognized as annotation.
 *
 * You will also need to make sure that your class file includes the line:
 * @code
 *   use Drupal\Core\Annotation\Translation;
 * @endcode
