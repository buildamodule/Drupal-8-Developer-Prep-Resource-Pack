/**
 * Defines an interface for entity field definitions.
 *
 * An entity field is a data object that holds the values of a particular field
 * for a particular entity (see \Drupal\Core\Entity\Field\FieldInterface). For
 * example, $node_1->body and $node_2->body contain different data and therefore
 * are different field objects.
 *
 * In contrast, an entity field *definition* is an object that returns
 * information *about* a field (e.g., its type and settings) rather than its
 * values. As such, if all the information about $node_1->body and $node_2->body
 * is the same, then the same field definition object can be used to describe
 * both.
 *
 * It is up to the class implementing this interface to manage where the
 * information comes from. For example, field.module provides an implementation
 * based on two levels of configuration. It allows the site administrator to add
 * custom fields to any entity type and bundle via the "field_entity" and
 * "field_instance" configuration entities. The former for storing configuration
 * that is independent of which entity type and bundle the field is added to,
 * and the latter for storing configuration that is specific to the entity type
 * and bundle. The class that implements "field_instance" configuration entities
 * also implements this interface, returning information from either itself, or
 * from the corresponding "field_entity" configuration, as appropriate.
 *
 * However, entity base fields, such as $node->title, are not managed by
 * field.module and its "field_entity"/"field_instance" configuration entities.
 * Therefore, their definitions are provided by different objects that implement
 * this interface.
 * @todo That is still in progress: https://drupal.org/node/1949932. Update this
 *   documentation with details when that's implemented.
 *
 * Field definitions may fully define a concrete data object (e.g.,
 * $node_1->body), or may provide a best-guess definition for a data object that
 * might come into existence later. For example, $node_1->body and $node_2->body
 * may have different definitions (e.g., if the node types are different). When
 * adding the "body" field to a View that can return nodes of different types,
 * the View can get a field definition that represents the "body" field
 * abstractly, and present Views configuration options to the administrator
 * based on that abstract definition, even though that abstract definition can
 * differ from the concrete definition of any particular node's body field.
