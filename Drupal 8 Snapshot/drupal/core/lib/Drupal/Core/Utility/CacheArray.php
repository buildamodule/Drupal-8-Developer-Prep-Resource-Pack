/**
 * Provides a caching wrapper to be used in place of large array structures.
 *
 * This class should be extended by systems that need to cache large amounts
 * of data and have it represented as an array to calling functions. These
 * arrays can become very large, so ArrayAccess is used to allow different
 * strategies to be used for caching internally (lazy loading, building caches
 * over time etc.). This can dramatically reduce the amount of data that needs
 * to be loaded from cache backends on each request, and memory usage from
 * static caches of that same data.
 *
 * Note that array_* functions do not work with ArrayAccess. Systems using
 * CacheArray should use this only internally. If providing API functions
 * that return the full array, this can be cached separately or returned
 * directly. However since CacheArray holds partial content by design, it
 * should be a normal PHP array or otherwise contain the full structure.
 *
 * Note also that due to limitations in PHP prior to 5.3.4, it is impossible to
 * write directly to the contents of nested arrays contained in this object.
 * Only writes to the top-level array elements are possible. So if you
 * previously had set $object['foo'] = array(1, 2, 'bar' => 'baz'), but later
 * want to change the value of 'bar' from 'baz' to 'foobar', you cannot do so
 * a targeted write like $object['foo']['bar'] = 'foobar'. Instead, you must
 * overwrite the entire top-level 'foo' array with the entire set of new
 * values: $object['foo'] = array(1, 2, 'bar' => 'foobar'). Due to this same
 * limitation, attempts to create references to any contained data, nested or
 * otherwise, will fail silently. So $var = &$object['foo'] will not throw an
 * error, and $var will be populated with the contents of $object['foo'], but
 * that data will be passed by value, not reference. For more information on
 * the PHP limitation, see the note in the official PHP documentation at
 * http://php.net/manual/arrayaccess.offsetget.php on ArrayAccess::offsetGet().
 *
 * By default, the class accounts for caches where calling functions might
 * request keys in the array that won't exist even after a cache rebuild. This
 * prevents situations where a cache rebuild would be triggered over and over
 * due to a 'missing' item. These cases are stored internally as a value of
 * NULL. This means that the offsetGet() and offsetExists() methods
 * must be overridden if caching an array where the top level values can
 * legitimately be NULL, and where $object->offsetExists() needs to correctly
 * return (equivalent to array_key_exists() vs. isset()). This should not
 * be necessary in the majority of cases.
 *
 * Classes extending this class must override at least the
 * resolveCacheMiss() method to have a working implementation.
 *
 * offsetSet() is not overridden by this class by default. In practice this
 * means that assigning an offset via arrayAccess will only apply while the
 * object is in scope and will not be written back to the persistent cache.
 * This follows a similar pattern to static vs. persistent caching in
 * procedural code. Extending classes may wish to alter this behavior, for
 * example by overriding offsetSet() and adding an automatic call to persist().
 *
 * @deprecated as of Drupal 8.0. Use \Drupal\Core\Cache\CacheCollector instead.
