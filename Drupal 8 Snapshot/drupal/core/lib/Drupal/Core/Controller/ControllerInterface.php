 * a lot of boilerplate code in the class. As an alternative, controllers that
 * contain only limited glue code ("thin" controllers) should instead extend
 * ControllerBase as that allows direct access to the container. That renders
 * the controller very difficult to unit test so should only be used for
 * controllers that are trivial in complexity.
