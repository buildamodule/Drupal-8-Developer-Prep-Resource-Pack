   * should be used on any unknown text that is intended to be printed to an HTML
   * page (especially text that may have come from untrusted users, since in that
   * case it prevents cross-site scripting and other security problems).

   *   A string containing placeholders.

   *   An associative array of replacements to make. Occurrences in $string of
   *   any key in $args are replaced with the corresponding value, after optional
   *   sanitization and formatting. The type of sanitization and formatting
   *   depends on the first character of the key:
   *   - @variable: Escaped to HTML using String::checkPlain(). Use this as the
   *     default choice for anything displayed on a page on the site.
   *   - %variable: Escaped to HTML and formatted using String::placeholder(),
   *     which makes it display as <em>emphasized</em> text.
   *   - !variable: Inserted as is, with no sanitization or formatting. Only use
   *     this for text that has already been prepared for HTML display (for
   *     example, user-supplied text that has already been run through
   *     String::checkPlain() previously, or is expected to contain some limited
   *     HTML tags and has already been run through filter_xss() previously).
   *
   *
   * @see t()
   * @ingroup sanitization
   *
   * @return mixte
   *  The formatted string with placeholders inserted, or FALSE if no args specified.
