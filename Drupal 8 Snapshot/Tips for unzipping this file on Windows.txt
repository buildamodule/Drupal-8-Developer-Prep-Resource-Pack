TIPS FOR UN-ZIPPING ON WINDOWS
--------------------------------------------------------

In the Drupal 8 Dev Prep videos, this drupal folder is uncompressed. However, our viewers with Windows machines had a hard time with the long file names deep in the Drupal directory structures, so we opted to zip this separately after the videos were made.

For best results, copy the drupal.zip file to the root directory of your hard drive (i.e. C:\) to uncompress it.
