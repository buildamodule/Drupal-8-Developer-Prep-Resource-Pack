"Drupal 8 Developer Prep" Resource Pack
=====================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "Drupal 8 Developer Prep" collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). In this collection, we go through all kinds of pretty fun Drupal 8 material, including:

* How to build a module in Drupal 8
* How to work with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in PHP
* How to use Composer
* How to use the same Symfony 2 components that Drupal 8 uses.

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
