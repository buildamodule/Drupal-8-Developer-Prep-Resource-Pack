Spaces are fine in keys    : Values can have spaces, too

"  Spaces at the beginning or end need quotes  ": 'You can use single or double quotes'

"Use double quotes for \n new lines": 'Use two single quotes '' for a quote in a single quote'

Types:
  Boolean: true
  Integer: 10
  "Null": null # Hey, a comment! Need quotes for the word 'Null'

Arrays can have keys and use any number of spaces (but not tabs):
  One:     1
  Two:     2
  Three:   3

Inline array with keys: {one: 1, two: 2, three: 3}

And oh my we can nest:
  Heron:
    - Tall
    - Beautiful
    - Loud (just come up behind one to find out)
  Swallow:
    European:
      - Brown
      - Quick
    Asian: [Brown,Quick]

We can do inline nesting as well:
  - [An array, [with, an, array, inside]]
  - [Another array, [with, an, array, inside]]

White space preserver: |
  The pipe is like a heredoc, where
    you can output    anything you'd like! Go white space!
  But you do have to indent.

Multi-lined text: >
  And the angled bracket
  lets you bring a multi-lined string
  into one line.
